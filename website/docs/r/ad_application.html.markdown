# azurerm_ad_application

Create a new application in Azure Active Directory. If your account is not an administrator in Active Directory an administrator must enable users to register applications within the User Settings. In addition, if you are using a Service Principal then it must have the permissions `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` under the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
}
```

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
  homepage = "http://homepage"
  identifier_uris = ["http://uri"]
  reply_urls = ["http://replyurl"]
  available_to_other_tenants = false
  oauth2_allow_implicit_flow = true
}
```

## Example Usage with Key Credential Certificate Authentication

```hcl
resource "tls_private_key" "example" {
  algorithm   = "ECDSA"
  ecdsa_curve = "P384"
}

resource "tls_self_signed_cert" "example" {
  key_algorithm   = "${tls_private_key.example.algorithm}"
  private_key_pem = "${tls_private_key.example.private_key_pem}"

  subject {
    common_name  = "example.com"
    organization = "ACME Examples, Inc"
  }

  validity_period_hours = 12

  allowed_uses = [
    "key_encipherment",
    "digital_signature",
    "server_auth",
    "cert_signing",
  ]
}

resource "azurerm_ad_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"

  key_credential {
    key_id = "32efa455-6b0e-489d-b3a7-d12675b767a5"
    type = "AsymmetricX509Cert"
    usage = "Verify"
    value = "${replace(tls_self_signed_cert.example.cert_pem, "/(-{5}.+?-{5})|(\\n)/", "")}"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with Password Credential Authentication

```hcl
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "test" {
  display_name = "example"

  password_credential {
    key_id = "32efa455-6b0e-489d-b3a7-d12675b767a5"
    value = "example"
    start_date = "2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00"
    end_date = "2018-03-02T00:00:00+00:00"
  }
}
```
